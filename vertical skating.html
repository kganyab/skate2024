  <p style="font-size:30px">Vert skateboarding, short for vertical skateboarding, is the act of riding a skateboard on a skate ramp 
  or other incline and involves the skateboarder transitioning from the horizontal plane to the vertical 
  plane in order to perform skateboarding tricks.Vert skateboarding has its genesis in "pool riding" -
  the riding of skateboards in an emptied backyard swimming pool during the 1970s. As riders moved
  from general street skateboarding and occasional "pool riding" into purpose-built skate parks, vert
  skateboarding became more popular. Skateboarders began to develop, and then practice, tricks and
  techniques specifically for vert skateboarding<p/>

<p style="font-size:30px">Vert skaters start out in a horizontal position at the bottom of the vert ramp or pool and slowly gain speed as 
they push themselves from one side of the ramp to the other until they're performing tricks from a vertical position.
 Unfortunately, public vert ramps have become hard to find. This has made it difficult for those who love the sport to
 find places to practice their skills, which worries some that this type of skating will soon be solely underground.<p/>

<p  style="font-size:30px">You may think that skating is skating regardless of where you choose to do it, but whether you skate indoors or outdoors makes a
 big difference in your skating experience. They both have their pros and cons, of course, but is one better than the other? It may
 all depend on preference. Let's look at some of the pros and cons of each.<p/>
