<p style=" font-size:30px;background-color:rgb(240, 240, 240)">The Berrics is a private indoor skatepark owned by professional skateboarders Steve Berra and Eric Koston.
 It is also a website providing content filmed in the skatepark, as well other skateboard-related media. The facility's name is a portmanteau of the owners' names 
 (the "Ber" of Berra's surname and the "ric" of Koston's first name).<p/>

<p  style="font-size:20px">Things change. Boards change, shoes change, tricks change, skaters change. Change is the manifestation of time, and time has shown us that skateboarding is here
 for as long as we—as individuals and as a community—create it into existence. Although much of the world is trying to stunt skateboarding's growth, there are
 enough rogue individuals out there continuing to make it happen. Whether it be by building ledges at a remote spot just east of downtown LA like Jason Hernandez,
 constructing mini-ramps in our backyards like Mikey Taylor, or buying buildings and constructing skateparks inside them like ourselves, we continue to grow because
 our will to skate and our will to survive is just that strong and because the only alternative is to quit and die. But we at the Berrics believe that life was made
 to live out of, not die out of. There's nothing special about dying. Anyone can do that. Push the future. — Steve Berra & Eric Koston.<p/>
